👋 Hello there! I'm Farhannuari Bani Romadhan, but you can call me Nuari.

🚀 My career journey kick-started as a developer back in 2019.

📚 It all began with my involvement in the "Technical .Net Fullstack Developer" bootcamp during that year. Since then, my passion as a full-stack developer has continued to grow, propelling me to keep evolving my career in the realm of development.

🛠️ Along this development journey, I've delved into a spectrum of technologies, including:

- Framework .Net
- .NET Core
- C# programming language
- VB.net
- SQL database management
- IIS web server configuration
- HTML markup language, CSS aesthetics, and JavaScript brilliance
- Version control with GIT
- Application of MVC architecture
- Development of REST APIs
- Grasping the Monolith concept
- Crafting N-tier architectures
- Exploring Microservices
- Immersing in Curl

🔧 To me, each line of code is a story, and I always relish the adventure it brings every day.

🌱 The zest for learning remains an ever-burning flame within me, ready to adapt to the relentless pace of technological evolution.
